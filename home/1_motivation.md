# 1. Motivation

This is the second programming paradigm I became aware of.

It's born both out of necessity (encapsulation - binding data with functions) and the will to be efficient (abstraction, inheritence - eliminate duplicate code).

I have understood it theoretically at a high level, what remains is just the implementation parts and getting more familiar with it.
